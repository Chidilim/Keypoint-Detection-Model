# Keypoint-Detection-Model

Created a model to detect pet noses in images using the Oxford-IIIT pet dataset. This involved modifying ResNet18 in PyTorch by incorporating an average pooling layer and a fully connected layer, while leveraging its pre-trained weights to enhance key point detection. The performance of the model was quantitatively evaluated, achieving a mean absolute error of 26.11, which reflects its accuracy in predicting the locations of pet noses.
